Today, I completed the schematic and PCB in under an hour! Last time, these two phases took at least 6 hours combined. Here is my schematic and PCB!

Today was a big day. I completely rehauled the design to make it a diode matrix instead. This allowed me to connect an OLED! I then rerouted everything and built a case. The case design went smoothly, as I had pizzaPad v1 for inspiration. After that, I designed some KMK firmware. Last time, I used Arduino, which was super annoying. Finally, I opened a PR with the proper format. Hopefully it gets accepted :)
